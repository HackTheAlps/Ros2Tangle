# Ros2Tangle
In 2019 more than 5.4 million robots are already running on ROS (Robot Operating System). In 2024 it is expected that additional 8.1 million robots are running with ROS. These numbers are taken from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1084823/global-ros-based-robot-market-volume/), the global No.1 Business Data Plattform. A big market for robots that is constantly growing is in the industry. Industrial Robots hold more than 60% market share for ROS market according to [TransparencyMarketResearch.com](https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/robot-operating-system-market.htm).

We focused to make it extremly easy to connect also your robot to the cloud. In this example we send the robot data to [IoTA streams](https://www.iota.org/solutions/streams). We used Oracle __ for data storage and __ as a visualization example.

In case something is unclear, please let us know so that we can make it clear. Thank you!
